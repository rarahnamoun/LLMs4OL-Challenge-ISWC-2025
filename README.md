# LLMs4OL Challenge @ ISWC 2025

This repository contains the code, prompts, and evaluation scripts for the **2nd Large Language Models for Ontology Learning (LLMs4OL) Challenge**, co-located with **ISWC 2025** in Nara, Japan (Nov 2–6, 2025) 

---

## Code Overview

The challenge investigates how well LLMs can support *automated ontology learning (OL)* via four tasks:

1. **Task A – Text2Onto**: Extract domain-specific terms and assign input types directly from raw text.
2. **Task B – Term Typing**: Classify given terms into general ontology types.
3. **Task C – Taxonomy Discovery**: Predict hierarchical "is‑a" relationships between type pairs.
